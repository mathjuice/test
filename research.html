  <p>I am grateful to work under the supervision of <a href="http://www.pollack.uga.edu" target="_blank">Paul Pollack</a>.</p>
  <p>My interests include problems in analytic and enumerative combinatorics, as well as analytic number theory. I seek to understand the subtle interplay between additive and multiplicative number theory, as highlighted by the connections between integers and integer partitions. The parallels between the combinatorial and analytic properties of power series, Dirichlet series, and modular forms remain a great mystery I strive to illuminate.</p>
  <p>I had a series of successful projects reviewing and writing mathematical models of infectious diseases. The computational skills I developed during this time I now utilize to develop and prove conjectures in number theory.</p>
  <p>While I enjoy research at the highest level, guiding younger students into the joys of research is a priority for me. I serve as a mentor for the Directed Reading Program (DRP) and the Undergraduate Research Mentor for combinatorics and number theory. I have mentored 10+ students in many areas of pure math and math education, and my collaborative efforts have led to 1 accepted publication, and multiple publications in preparation.</p>
