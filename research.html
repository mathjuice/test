  <p>I am currently researching analytic number theory under the supervision of <a href="http://www.pollack.uga.edu">Paul Pollack</a>. Broadly speaking my interests are contained in the intersection of enumerative combinatorics, prime number theory, and applied optimization. My previous research endeavors include combinatorial optimization (specifically pattern packing in permutations and other words) as well as infectious disease epidemiology (specifically mathematical modeling of Typhoid, Cholera, and Ebola).</p>
  <p>I also am a graduate mentor for the Directed Reading Program (DRP) at UGA and have worked on several projects with undergraduate participants in the areas of combinatorics, combinatorial game theory, and artificial intelligence.</p>
